## How to fix errors in {{ path }}

microloop cycle until clean (any error restarts microloop):
1. `just unveil-next-error {{ path }}`
2. attempt atomic surgery fix
3. `just see-what-you-did-there` after every change.
4. plan scoped commits according to actual changes
5. `just pre-commit`
6. commit

## Commit template (subject <=60 chars, body <=70 chars):

<type>(<scope>): <short, imperative subject>

- <One-line summary or top-level change>
- <Concrete list of changes, one per bullet>
- <Notes about breaking changes, compatibility, or migration steps (if any)>
- Testing: <what was tested / tests added / how to run them>
- Reviewer: <focus points / what to review>

Optional sections (only when relevant)
- Benefits: <why this change helps>
- Risk/Drawbacks: <known risks>
- References: <issue/PR numbers or links>
