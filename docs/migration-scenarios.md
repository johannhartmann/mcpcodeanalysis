## E-commerce Monolith to Modular Architecture

### Scenario
A 5-year-old e-commerce platform with 500K lines of code needs to scale independently and improve deployment velocity.

### Initial Analysis
```python
# Step 1: Analyze the monolith
analysis = analyze_migration_readiness(
    repository_url="https://github.com/acme/ecommerce-monolith"
)

# Results show:
# - 7 bounded contexts identified
# - 89 migration candidates
# - 12 circular dependencies
# - Complexity: Medium-High
# - Readiness score: 0.72
```

### Discovered Bounded Contexts
1. **Product Catalog** - High cohesion, low coupling (0.85 readiness)
2. **Shopping Cart** - Medium cohesion, medium coupling (0.70 readiness)
3. **Order Management** - Complex, high coupling (0.55 readiness)
4. **Payment Processing** - Well isolated (0.90 readiness)
5. **Customer Management** - Medium complexity (0.75 readiness)
6. **Inventory** - Tightly coupled to orders (0.60 readiness)
7. **Shipping** - Good candidate (0.80 readiness)

### Migration Strategy: Strangler Fig Pattern

```python
# Step 2: Create migration plan with Strangler Fig
plan = create_migration_plan(
    repository_url="https://github.com/acme/ecommerce-monolith",
    plan_name="E-commerce Modularization 2024",
    strategy="strangler_fig",
    target_architecture="modular_monolith",
    team_size=8,
    timeline_weeks=24,
    risk_tolerance="medium"
)
```

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
```python
# Extract Payment Processing first (highest readiness)
interface = design_module_interface(
    repository_url="https://github.com/acme/ecommerce-monolith",
    package_path="src/payments",
    target_architecture="modular_monolith",
    include_events=True
)

# Generated interface includes:
# - PaymentService with processPayment, refundPayment, getPaymentStatus
# - DTOs: PaymentRequest, PaymentResponse, RefundRequest
# - Events: PaymentProcessed, PaymentFailed, RefundIssued
# - Security: Token validation, PCI compliance boundaries
```

### Phase 2: Core Extraction (Weeks 5-12)
```python
# Monitor progress as team extracts modules
progress = track_migration_progress(plan_id=plan["plan_id"])

# After Payment module:
# - Extract Product Catalog (independent reads)
# - Extract Shipping (clear boundaries)
# - Create API Gateway for routing

# Real-time monitoring shows:
# - 3/7 modules extracted
# - 42% overall progress
# - Health score: 88/100
# - No critical issues
```

### Phase 3: Complex Modules (Weeks 13-20)
```python
# Handle circular dependency between Orders and Inventory
impact = analyze_migration_impact(
    repository_url="https://github.com/acme/ecommerce-monolith",
    module_path="src/orders",
    impact_type="extraction"
)

# Impact analysis reveals:
# - 47 files need modification
# - 12 interfaces to create
# - Saga pattern needed for distributed transactions
# - Estimated 120 hours of work

# Break circular dependency first
steps = [
    "Introduce OrderInventoryInterface",
    "Implement event-based inventory updates",
    "Add compensating transactions",
    "Extract Order Management",
    "Extract Inventory with new interface"
]
```

### Phase 4: Completion (Weeks 21-24)
```python
# Final modules and optimization
dashboard = get_migration_dashboard(
    repository_url="https://github.com/acme/ecommerce-monolith"
)

# Dashboard shows:
# - All 7 modules successfully extracted
# - 15% performance improvement
# - 60% faster deployments
# - 80% reduction in merge conflicts

# Extract patterns for future use
patterns = extract_migration_patterns(plan_id=plan["plan_id"])
```

### Results
- **Timeline**: 24 weeks (on schedule)
- **Team Utilization**: 85% average
- **Technical Debt Reduced**: 40%
- **Deployment Frequency**: From weekly to multiple daily
- **MTTR**: Reduced from 4 hours to 30 minutes

### Lessons Learned
```python
lessons = learn_from_failures(plan_id=plan["plan_id"])

# Key learnings:
# 1. Payment extraction first was correct - high value, low risk
# 2. Breaking Orders-Inventory dependency took 50% more time than estimated
# 3. Event sourcing helped maintain consistency
# 4. Feature flags essential for gradual rollout
```

## Banking System Microservices Transformation

### Scenario
A legacy banking core system (1M+ lines) needs to transform into microservices for regulatory compliance and scalability.

### Risk-First Approach
```python
# Assess risks given critical nature
risks = assess_migration_risks(
    repository_url="https://github.com/bank/core-system"
)

# Critical risks identified:
# 1. Data consistency during migration (probability: 0.8, impact: 0.9)
# 2. Regulatory compliance gaps (probability: 0.6, impact: 1.0)
# 3. Security vulnerabilities during transition (probability: 0.7, impact: 0.9)
# 4. Performance degradation (probability: 0.5, impact: 0.7)
```

### Migration Strategy: Parallel Run
```python
# Given critical nature, use Parallel Run strategy
plan = create_migration_plan(
    repository_url="https://github.com/bank/core-system",
    plan_name="Banking Core Modernization",
    strategy="parallel_run",
    target_architecture="microservices",
    team_size=15,
    timeline_weeks=52,
    risk_tolerance="low"
)

# Plan includes:
# - 156 migration steps
# - 12 phases with validation gates
# - Parallel run for 3 months per service
# - Comprehensive rollback procedures
```

### Execution with Validation Gates
```python
# Each service migration follows strict validation
for service in ["accounts", "transactions", "loans", "kyc"]:
    # Design interface with security focus
    interface = design_module_interface(
        repository_url="https://github.com/bank/core-system",
        package_path=f"src/{service}",
        target_architecture="microservices",
        include_events=True
    )

    # Start migration
    step_id = get_step_for_service(service)
    start_migration_step(step_id=step_id)

    # Run in parallel for validation period
    validation = validate_migration_step(
        step_id=step_id,
        validation_type="parallel_run",
        validation_criteria={
            "data_consistency": 100,  # Must be perfect
            "transaction_accuracy": 100,
            "performance_baseline": {
                "response_time_ms": 100,
                "throughput_tps": 1000
            },
            "security_scan": "pass",
            "regulatory_compliance": "certified"
        }
    )

    # Only proceed if validation passes
    if validation["passed"]:
        complete_migration_step(step_id=step_id, success=True)
    else:
        rollback_migration_step(step_id=step_id, reason=validation["failures"])
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```python
# Set up comprehensive monitoring
health_check = check_migration_health(plan_id=plan["plan_id"])

# Health checks include:
# - Data reconciliation (every 5 minutes)
# - Transaction monitoring (real-time)
# - Performance benchmarks (hourly)
# - Security scans (daily)
# - Compliance audits (weekly)

# Anomaly detection for critical issues
anomalies = detect_anomalies(plan_id=plan["plan_id"])
# Alerts on:
# - Transaction discrepancies
# - Unusual latency patterns
# - Failed reconciliations
# - Security events
```

### Results After 52 Weeks
- **Services Migrated**: 12 core services
- **Zero Downtime**: Achieved through parallel run
- **Data Integrity**: 100% maintained
- **Performance**: 20% improvement overall
- **Compliance**: Passed all regulatory audits
- **Rollbacks Required**: 2 (handled gracefully)

## SaaS Platform Event-Driven Migration

### Scenario
Multi-tenant SaaS platform moving from synchronous to event-driven architecture for better scalability.

### Initial State
```python
analysis = analyze_migration_readiness(
    repository_url="https://github.com/saas/platform"
)

# Platform characteristics:
# - 2000 tenants
# - 300K lines of code
# - Heavy database coupling
# - Synchronous API calls everywhere
# - Performance bottlenecks in reporting
```

### Event-Driven Design
```python
# Design events for each bounded context
contexts = ["user_management", "billing", "reporting", "notifications", "integrations"]

for context in contexts:
    interface = design_module_interface(
        repository_url="https://github.com/saas/platform",
        package_path=f"src/{context}",
        target_architecture="event_driven",
        include_events=True
    )

    # Generated events like:
    # - UserCreated, UserUpdated, UserDeleted
    # - SubscriptionActivated, PaymentProcessed
    # - ReportGenerated, ReportFailed
    # - NotificationSent, NotificationBounced
```

### Gradual Event Introduction
```python
# Phase 1: Add event publishing to existing code
# Phase 2: Create event consumers
# Phase 3: Remove synchronous calls
# Phase 4: Optimize event flow

# Monitor event flow health
event_metrics = monitor_step_execution(
    step_id=current_step_id
)

# Track:
# - Event throughput: 10K events/second
# - Processing latency: < 100ms p99
# - Dead letter queue: < 0.1%
# - Event ordering: maintained per tenant
```

### Performance Optimization
```python
# Optimize based on event patterns
optimization = optimize_migration_plan(
    plan_id=plan["plan_id"],
    minimize_time=False,  # Focus on quality
    minimize_risk=True,   # Ensure stability
    maximize_quality=True # Comprehensive testing
)

# Recommendations:
# - Batch events for reporting (10x throughput)
# - Use event sourcing for audit trail
# - Implement CQRS for read/write separation
# - Add circuit breakers for resilience
```

## Healthcare System Gradual Decomposition

### Scenario
Healthcare management system with strict HIPAA compliance needs modernization without disrupting patient care.

### Compliance-First Planning
```python
# Create plan with healthcare-specific constraints
plan = create_migration_plan(
    repository_url="https://github.com/health/ehr-system",
    plan_name="EHR Modernization Initiative",
    strategy="gradual",  # Safest approach
    target_architecture="modular_monolith",  # Not full microservices yet
    team_size=10,
    timeline_weeks=40,
    risk_tolerance="low"
)

# Special considerations:
# - HIPAA compliance at every step
# - Zero patient data exposure risk
# - Maintain 99.99% uptime
# - Audit trail for all changes
```

### Module Extraction Priority
```python
# Based on risk and value
extraction_order = [
    "appointment_scheduling",  # Low risk, high value
    "patient_demographics",    # Medium risk, high compliance needs
    "clinical_notes",         # High risk, complex encryption
    "lab_results",           # Integration heavy
    "billing",               # Financial compliance
    "prescriptions"          # Highest risk, drug interactions
]

# Each module requires:
# - PHI encryption verification
# - Access control validation
# - Audit logging confirmation
# - Backup/recovery testing
```

### Validation and Compliance
```python
# Healthcare-specific validation
for module in extraction_order:
    validation = validate_migration_step(
        step_id=get_step_id(module),
        validation_type="healthcare_compliance",
        validation_criteria={
            "hipaa_compliance": "certified",
            "phi_encryption": "AES-256",
            "access_control": "role_based",
            "audit_trail": "complete",
            "data_integrity": 100,
            "integration_tests": "passing",
            "performance": {
                "response_time_ms": 200,
                "availability": 99.99
            }
        }
    )
```

### Knowledge Capture
```python
# Document healthcare-specific patterns
pattern = add_pattern_to_library(
    name="HIPAA-Compliant Module Extraction",
    category="healthcare",
    description="Pattern for extracting modules with PHI data",
    implementation_steps=[
        "Identify all PHI data in module",
        "Implement encryption boundaries",
        "Create access control layer",
        "Add comprehensive audit logging",
        "Implement data anonymization for dev/test",
        "Validate with compliance team",
        "Perform security penetration testing",
        "Get sign-off from Chief Medical Officer"
    ],
    prerequisites=[
        "HIPAA compliance training completed",
        "Security team approval",
        "Encrypted data storage ready",
        "Audit infrastructure in place"
    ],
    best_practices=[
        "Never log PHI in plain text",
        "Use field-level encryption",
        "Implement break-glass procedures",
        "Regular compliance audits"
    ],
    avg_effort_hours=160
)
```

### Results
- **Modules Extracted**: 6 over 40 weeks
- **Compliance Maintained**: 100% HIPAA compliant
- **Zero Security Incidents**: During migration
- **Performance Improved**: 30% faster patient lookups
- **Maintainability**: 50% reduction in change failure rate
