# MCP Tool Description Quality Analysis

## Overview
After analyzing the MCP tool descriptions in the codebase, I've identified several areas where the descriptions could be improved for better usability by MCP hosts like Claude Desktop.

## Current Tool Inventory

### Repository Management Tools (6 tools)
1. **add_repository** - "Add a new repository to track"
2. **list_repositories** - "List all tracked repositories"
3. **scan_repository** - "Scan or rescan a repository"
4. **update_embeddings** - "Update embeddings for a repository"
5. **get_repository_stats** - "Get detailed statistics for a repository"
6. **delete_repository** - "Delete a repository and all its data"

### Domain-Driven Design Tools (6 tools)
1. **extract_domain_model** - "Extract domain entities and relationships from code using LLM analysis"
2. **find_aggregate_roots** - "Find aggregate roots in the codebase using domain analysis"
3. **analyze_bounded_context** - "Analyze a bounded context and its relationships"
4. **suggest_ddd_refactoring** - "Suggest Domain-Driven Design refactoring improvements"
5. **find_bounded_contexts** - "Find all bounded contexts in the codebase"
6. **generate_context_map** - "Generate a context map showing relationships between bounded contexts"

### Analysis Tools (5 tools)
1. **analyze_coupling** - "Analyze coupling between bounded contexts with metrics and recommendations"
2. **suggest_context_splits** - "Suggest how to split large bounded contexts based on cohesion analysis"
3. **detect_anti_patterns** - "Detect DDD anti-patterns like anemic models, god objects, and circular dependencies"
4. **analyze_domain_evolution** - "Analyze how the domain model has evolved over time"
5. **get_domain_metrics** - "Get comprehensive domain health metrics and insights"

### Migration Tools (4 tools)
1. **create_migration_plan** - "Create a detailed migration plan for transforming a monolithic codebase"
2. **start_migration_step** - "Start execution of a migration step"
3. **complete_migration_step** - "Mark a migration step as completed"
4. **extract_migration_patterns** - "Extract reusable patterns from completed migration plans"

### Package Analysis Tool (1 tool)
1. **analyze_packages** - "Analyze the package structure of a repository"

## Analysis of Description Quality

### Good Examples

1. **detect_anti_patterns**
   - Description: "Detect DDD anti-patterns like anemic models, god objects, and circular dependencies"
   - ‚úÖ Clear about what it does
   - ‚úÖ Provides specific examples
   - ‚úÖ Actionable

2. **analyze_coupling**
   - Description: "Analyze coupling between bounded contexts with metrics and recommendations"
   - ‚úÖ Clear purpose
   - ‚úÖ Mentions output types (metrics and recommendations)

3. **create_migration_plan**
   - Description: "Create a detailed migration plan for transforming a monolithic codebase"
   - ‚úÖ Clear action
   - ‚úÖ Specific use case

### Poor or Unclear Examples

1. **scan_repository**
   - Description: "Scan or rescan a repository"
   - ‚ùå Doesn't explain what scanning does
   - ‚ùå Unclear when to use vs add_repository
   - üí° Better: "Scan repository for code changes and update the analysis database"

2. **update_embeddings**
   - Description: "Update embeddings for a repository"
   - ‚ùå Technical jargon ("embeddings") without context
   - ‚ùå Unclear why/when to use
   - üí° Better: "Update semantic search index for improved code search accuracy"

3. **start_migration_step**
   - Description: "Start execution of a migration step"
   - ‚ùå Lacks context about what a migration step is
   - ‚ùå Unclear prerequisites
   - üí° Better: "Start execution of a migration step from an existing migration plan"

## Parameter Description Quality

### Good Examples
- `repository_url: "GitHub repository URL"` - Clear and specific
- `force_full_scan: "Force full scan instead of incremental"` - Explains the effect
- `min_entities: "Minimum entities for a context to be considered"` - Clear threshold

### Poor Examples
- `repository_id: "Repository ID"` - Doesn't explain how to get the ID
- `step_id: "ID of the migration step to start"` - No context on how to find step IDs

## Missing Core Tools

The documentation mentions these tools, but they appear to be implemented as resources, not tools:
- search_code
- explain_code
- find_definition
- find_usage
- analyze_dependencies
- suggest_refactoring
- find_similar_code
- get_code_structure

This is confusing for MCP clients expecting these as tools.

## Recommendations

### 1. Improve Tool Descriptions
- Add context about when to use each tool
- Explain prerequisites or dependencies
- Clarify the output format/structure
- Use less technical jargon

### 2. Enhance Parameter Descriptions
- Explain how to obtain IDs (repository_id, step_id, etc.)
- Provide valid value examples for enums
- Clarify optional vs required parameters more explicitly

### 3. Add Tool Examples
Consider adding example usage in tool descriptions:
```
description="Scan repository for code changes. Use after modifying code or to refresh analysis. Returns: files added/modified/deleted counts"
```

### 4. Implement Missing Core Tools
Either implement the missing core analysis tools or update documentation to clarify they're resources.

### 5. Group Related Tools
Consider adding prefixes or categories to make tool discovery easier:
- `repo_add`, `repo_scan`, `repo_delete`
- `ddd_extract_model`, `ddd_find_aggregates`
- `migration_create_plan`, `migration_start_step`

### 6. Add Return Value Descriptions
Most tools don't describe their return format, making it hard for LLMs to know what to expect.

## Conclusion

While the tool descriptions are functional, they could be significantly improved to be more user-friendly for MCP hosts. The main issues are:
1. Lack of context about when/why to use tools
2. Technical jargon without explanation
3. Missing information about prerequisites and outputs
4. Confusion between tools and resources for core functionality

With these improvements, the MCP server would be much more accessible to LLM agents trying to use it effectively.
